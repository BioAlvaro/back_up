This backup is an improved version of the previous one.

What it does is it checks if the files have been modified in the original folder in a period x of time.

If the have not been modified, the md5 will be calculated, then copied (if they're not in the backup already),
then calculate the md5 in the backup folder and compare the md5 original with the latest one.
